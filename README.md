# MORAY

**Your personal cinema archive, powered by AI.**

Moray is a minimal, professional movie tracking application built on the **"Live Forever"** architecture. It combines a distraction-free interface with **Google Firebase** for permanent storage and **Groq AI** for intelligent recommendations.

## Features

### AI 
- **Smart Pick:** Can't decide? Tell the AI how much time you have (e.g., *"90 mins, sci-fi"*), and it will analyze your specific list to recommend the perfect movie.
- **AI Auto-Fill:** Automatically generates 1-sentence reviews and ratings for any title so you don't have to type generic notes.

### Cinema Manager
- **Instant Search:** Fetches metadata and high-res posters via OMDb API.
- **Organization:** Seamlessly move titles between **"To Watch"** and **"History"**.
- **Minimal UI:** A professional "Zinc" dark theme designed for focus, not clutter.

### The Backend
- **Firebase Auth:** Secure Google & Email login that persists forever.
- **Cloud Firestore:** Real-time database that never "pauses" due to inactivity (unlike Supabase).
- **Vercel Serverless:** Securely handles API keys so they are never exposed to the client.
